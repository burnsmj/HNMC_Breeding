## Purpose:
Food-grade corn is an economically important crop in the United States and worldwide. However, 
in the United States, it makes up less than 2% of the corn grown by acre. This has led to reduced 
resources for improving food-grade corn, which affects the manufacturing process and downstream consumer
satisfaction with final products. One trait that impacts many other quality traits is the amount of 
water absorbed during the nixtamalization process. Recent progress has been made in studying this trait
in an inbred system, and developing an application for predicting nixtamalization moisture content in
both inbred and hybrid systems. This work expands on previous work by considering nixtamalization 
moisture content in an breeding context through consideration of both hybrid and inbred germplasm.

## Pipeline Description:
Using the application CHIP-NMC, nixtamalization moisture content was predicted for hybrid and inbred 
maize samples from 3 populations (Wisconsin Diversity Panel - inbreds and hybrids, modern commercial 
hybrids from industry partners, and historically relevant hybrids from the midwest). Using the predictions
from this application, the paritioning of variance was assessed based on experimental design, the 
correlation between nixtamalization moisture content and yield was assessed, and the genetic architecture
of nixtamalization moisture content was assessed through inbred-hybrid comparisons, and a genome-wide 
association study. After these analyses were complete, a genomic prediction model was created to assess
the ability to predict nixtamaliation moisture content even earlier in the breeding pipeline.
